This is a tool designed to improve the play of HK Mahjong players, and is a fork of the original Riichi version. It includes an efficiency trainer to help players identify the best tile to discard, a replay analyzer to check the efficiency (and safety, if relevant) of a player's discards, an all-last trainer to assist with comebacks, and a few random utilities.

When referring to efficiency here, we're referring to tile acceptance of the hand in the present. There's no look-ahead for future efficiency. It is an easily measurable thing, and playing towards it is sufficient for many players when combined with adequate defensive play.
